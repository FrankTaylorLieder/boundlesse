# Boundlesse - A boundless life (esse) simulation

Boundlesse is a Rust-based desktop app for running Conway's Game of Life.

It's goals are:

- No artificial limits
  - The universe can be as large as needed, limited only by memory to store and update it.
- As fast as possible
  - Some attention has been paid to performance, but there is probably a long way to go!
- Explore life configrations from [LifeWiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki).
  - You can load RLE encoded patterns to initialise the Universe.

Status:

- This is a very early version...it's UI is somewhat rough.
- There are many possible new features that could be added.
