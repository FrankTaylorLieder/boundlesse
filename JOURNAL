Commit: 84950f2

  - Ref: https://lbarasti.com/post/game_of_life/
  - Created a sparse grid data structure, with unit tests.

Commit: f03a329

- First attempt at the sparse version of the algorithm.
  - Looks like it's not correct, or fast!

Commit: 0d0b866

- Fix: get the thresholds right!

Commit:

- SOLVED: seems to be skipping frames if things take too long. Hence jerky output.
  - The grid lines are being drawn too often... removing them speeds up things hugely!
  - Draw the lines in a separate phase.
- Change draw to iterate the actual cells, not all cells.
